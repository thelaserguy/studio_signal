# Studio Status Signal: Door Status Light

This repository contains code and design files for a door status light system using an Arduino Nano.

## Project Description

This project is a door status signal system. It uses an Arduino Nano, 3 LEDs, a touch sensor (or switch/button), and a breadboard. Depending on the state of the switch, different LEDs light up to show the door's status.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino Nano
- 3 LEDs
- 3 Resistors
- 1 touch sensor, switch, or button
- Breadboard

### Wiring

The switch is wired to post 2, and the resistors are wired to posts 9, 10, and 11.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Open the .ino file from this repository
4. Choose the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE
5. Click Upload

## Usage

Once you've uploaded the code to your Arduino, your door status light should be operational.
