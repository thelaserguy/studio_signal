# Studio Status Signal: Door Status Light

This repository contains code and design files for a door status light system using an Arduino Nano.

## Project Description

This project is a door status signal system. It uses an Arduino Nano, 3 LEDs, a momentary switch (push button), and a breadboard or solder. When the switch is pressed, it sends a signal to the board, different LEDs light up to show the present status. (I'm using red for don't enter, blue for come in quietly, and green for enter freely)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino Nano
- 3 LEDs
- 3 Resistors
- 1 touch sensor, switch, or button
- Breadboard (if not soldering)
- Wires 
- Soldering equipment (if not using breadboard)

### Wiring

The switch is wired to post 2, and the resistors are wired from the annode (positive, longer leg of diode) to posts 9, 10, and 11

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Open the .ino file from this repository
4. Choose the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE
5. Click Upload

## Usage

Once you've uploaded the code to your Arduino, your door status light should be operational.
